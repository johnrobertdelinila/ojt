<p class="double">{ } OUTSTANDING (5): Performance far exceeds expectations and requirements of the position.
The student consistently integrates a wide variety of skills to outstandingly and effectively solve problems
and carry out duties, responsibilities and objectives well beyond the expectations of the position.
Outcomes and solutions are routinely excellent and seldom matched by others. S/He demonstrates the
highest level of performance standards in handling all assignments. His/Her performance is consistent
with the behavior associated with the selected critical performance factors. Overall, performance
demonstrates a very high degree of expertise and serves as a model of excellence for other students
undergoing Practicum. S/He adds value to the organization well beyond what was expected. His/Her high
level of sustained performance merits special recognition and compares with the best this office has seen.
Very few students achieve this level of competency, particularly in an overall evaluation. </p><br>
<p class="double">{ } EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS (4): Performance often exceeds expectations and requirements of
the position. The student frequently demonstrates the ability to integrate a variety of skills to effectively
solve problems and carry out duties, responsibilities and objectives beyond the expectations required in
the job assigned. His/Her performance is consistent with the behavior associated with the performance
factors used for our employees. S/He adds value to the organization beyond what is expected.</p> <br>
<p class="double">{ } SATISFACTORY (3): Performance meets and sometimes may exceed expectations and
requirements of the position. Fully competent. The student adds value to the organization and is a fully
competent performer. Critical goals, tasks, and projects are achieved within acceptable standards.
During the Practicum period, there may have been some accomplishments that exceeded expectations,
some that may have met expectations and, possibly, some areas where results may not have fully met
expectations. Overall, s/he demonstrates the ability to handle projects or assignments within the scope of
the assigned job and demonstrates the ability to integrate a variety of skills to solve problems and carry
out duties, responsibilities and objectives. His/Her performance is generally consistent with the behavior
associated with the performance factors used for our employees. </p><br>
<p class="double">{ } NEEDS IMPROVEMENT (2): Performance often does not meet expectations and requirements
of the position. Improvement is necessary. The student needs further development and/or
improvement in one or more of the performance factors. S/He requires more than normal amount of
guidance and follow-up to assure that assignments were progressing adequately. Performance is
occasionally consistent with the behavior associated with the performance factors. Sustained progress
and improvement are required in one or more of the performance factors. </p><br>
<p class="double">{ } UNSATISFACTORY (1): Performance consistently does not meet expectations and requirements
of the assigned job. Improvement is required. Performance is below the minimum needed to fulfill
assigned duties, responsibilities, objectives and expectations. S/He requires an unreasonable amount of
direction and guidance.</p></center>
